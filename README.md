## Quick reference for useful things

### Add tap recognition to any element that inherits gestures
```csharp
elem.GestureRecognizers.Add(new TapGestureRecognizer
{
 Command = new Command(() => {
  // Whatever operation you want to do  ( this isn't async )
 })
});
```
### Easy way to do an operation in ui thread only after async
```csharp
Task.Run(async() =>
{
 // Do an async operation here, or if you don't actually need to use an await, take async out of the
 // lamba func
 
 Device.BeginInvokeOnMainThread(() => 
 {
  // Do something in the ui thread. 
  })
});
// This is particularly useful when you want to avoid race conditions. The backcode of EventPage shows this being used
```

At the end of this iteration, the app will retrieve event information from the database and present it to the user, who will be accessing the app as a Guest (no registered account).  The app will also provide a link to allow Guests to register for an event.
